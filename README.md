# Road Closures UX Project
## Project Lead: Cassie Wilcox @csndra0504
## Stakeholders: Scott Walker, Natalie Bednarz - City of Orlando


Road Closures project is a UX project exploring the current user experience of Scott Walker, a city employee as he creates the documents and uploads the information to the public concerning road closures with in the Orlando city limits. 

Our goal is to create a solution that will have 2 outcomes:


1. Make Scott's job easier, not harder. 
2. Output data in an open format to the Data Portal to be used in a map solution available to the public. 

This project will begin as a UX project, mapping Scotts journey as he completes his job to understand his process and pain points. Then we will prototype solutions and work with Scott in a co-creation process to ensure the final product is something that meets Scott's needs.

### New to the project?
Here are a few things you can do to get oriented if you are interested in contributing to this project:

* Join the #road-event-app channel in the [Code for Orlando Slack](https://codefororlando.herokuapp.com/)
* Review current [Orlando Road Closures Report](http://www.cityoforlando.net/roadclosure/)
* Review [Open511 Road Event Data Standard](http://www.open511.org/documentation/1.0/root.html)
    * [Open 511 Demo App](https://demo.open511.org/map/) (Can we reuse any of this?)
* Review Meeting Notes (below)

### Open Questions

Answers will be added as they are gathered. :)

* What geographical region is Scott Walker responsible for?
  * City of Orlando
* How long does his process currently take? How long will the shadowing session need to last?
    * See [these Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV6v_skqq344i2kqKwC8ZAnq4z-eJafa9Yh3HOtDc-E/edit?usp=sharing)
* How many people can attend the shadowing session?
    * Erin Denton, Matt Lavoie, and Cassandra Wilcox attended
* What information can we / can't we record during the shadowing session? Photos?
    * We were unable to capture video, but Scott allowed us to take a photo of him :)
* How do 18A Special Events Permits come to Scott Walker? How are they processed?
    * [Online Permit Application](https://app.mygov.us/task/city/cityhome.php?cityname=367)
    * See [these Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV6v_skqq344i2kqKwC8ZAnq4z-eJafa9Yh3HOtDc-E/edit?usp=sharing)
* Is any of the "internal" info related to road closures (that is not published publicly) protected/private?
* Where would the app be hosted? Who will pay for hosting? What security measures are needed?
* How technically proficient is our target user? Does he have a smart phone?
    * See [these Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JV6v_skqq344i2kqKwC8ZAnq4z-eJafa9Yh3HOtDc-E/edit?usp=sharing)

###Research Needed:

* How does Google Maps use/present road closure information?
* How does info from current [Road Closure Report](http://www.cityoforlando.net/roadclosure/) compare to [Open511](http://www.open511.org/) standard?
* [Open 511 Demo App](https://demo.open511.org/map/) Is this app open source? Can we reuse any of it?
