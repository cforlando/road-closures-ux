# Road Closures UX Project
## Project Lead: Cassie Wilcox @csndra0504
## Stakeholders: Scott Walker, Natalie Bednarz - City of Orlando

Road Closures project is UX project exploring the current user experience of Scott Walker, a city employee as he creates the documents and uploads the information to the public concerning road closures with in the Orlando city limits. 

Our goal is to create a solution that will have 2 outcomes: 

1. Make Scott's job easier, not harder. 
2. Output data in an open format to the Data Portal to be used in a map solution avalible to the public. 

This project will begin as a UX project, mapping Scotts journey as he completes his job to understand his process and pain points. Then we will prototype solutions and work with Scott in a co-creation process to ensure the final product is something that meets Scott's needs.
